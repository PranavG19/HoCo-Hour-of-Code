            What is the Hour of Code?
          </div>
          <div class="normal-text color-grey">
            The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to
            show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It
            has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities
            but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. You can check out the official Hour of Code <a

          <div class="normal-text color-grey">
            This event, Howard County’s Hour of Code, is a 5-day event taking place from May 24 to May 28, 2021.

          </div>
          <div class="normal-text color-grey">
            Every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving
            skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any
            21st-century career path. See more stats <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/stats">here</a>.

          <div class="question color-black mb-1">
            How much can one learn in an hour?
          </div>
          <div class="normal-text color-grey">
            The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One
            hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages,
            for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS
            students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender and ethnic and socioeconomic
            groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels.
            Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour - to learn for a
            whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a
            college major) as a result.
            <br> <br>
            Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they
            can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of
            thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on
            online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is
            something their students want and their teachers are capable of.
            <br> <br>
            Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.

            Our teachers in Howard County are some of the best educators in the world- take advantage of the
            opportunities HCPSS offers! If you liked learning about CS, then take some of our county’s CS courses and
            join the Computer Programming Career Academy.

          <div class="normal-text color-grey">
            <b>Individual Points</b> are earned by completing articles, up to 60 points maximum.<br>
            <b>Individual Prizes</b> are awarded by a county-wide raffle at the end of the event. Each of your individual points counts as 1 raffle ticket (35 points --> 35 tickets) for a maximum of 60 tickets in this raffle. <br>
            <br>

            <b>School Points</b> are designed so if every student at your school earned their maximum 60 individual points, the school would have 10,000 school points. It's essentially a <i>percentage</i> equivalent (how much your school has participated / how much could they have participated) and converted to 10,000 points. <br>
            <b>School Prizes</b> have 3 components:
            <ul>
              <li>HoCoHOC Winner Banner - Awarded to the winning school</li>
              <li>$300 - Awarded to the winning school's computer science department or relevant club</li>
              <li>$300 - Awarded to a randomly drawn school's computer science department or relevant club, where each school point counts as 1 entry into the raffle</li>
